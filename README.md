# Crafting interpreters in Rust

I'm going through Robert Nystrom's
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book in Rust. The
goal is to both learn more about programming language implementation and about
how to convert the Java code in the book into a more expressive Rust style.
